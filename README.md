# WebAppSearch
This app is specifically created for Zenefts webapp task.

How to use:
Type in the search bar any place or name, e.g., pizza and it will search the nearby places if location not specified. By default the map will zoom over the Zenefits SF office location.

This app works fine with any device. In case, the app is hosted on some other domain, the domain address should be authenticated first in my personalised API credentials.
